# Geometry Rays
 Geometry rays is an organization founded by [Puppet](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57) and [Voltaged](https://github.com/VoltagedDebunked)

 We are making a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash) fangame in rust and raylib with a backend hosted in php.

# **WE ARE NOT THE OFFICIAL GEOMETRY DASH**
 Please go check out the original game if you can. Its amazing and I (Puppet) love it a lot. Its my favorite game in the world rn and I totally dont have an addiction.

# Note
 Voltaged was using chatgpt to generate his code in secret.

 I have since kicked him out of the dev team.

 I (Puppet) am the only dev now.
