# Geometry Rays
 Geometry rays is an organization founded by [Puppet](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57) and [Voltaged](https://github.com/VoltagedDebunked) (he is not in the dev team anymore)

 We are making a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash) fangame in rust and macroquad with a backend hosted in php.
